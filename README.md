# Bookmarklets
Bookmarklets I decided were cool made by me

###### Note: This works on most browsers but some do not support bookmarklets. It also won't work on sites where bookmarklets are blocked (like codepen or github)... If you ever need to run any bookmarklet without internet or on a blank webpage that does not show up in your history, go to about:blank on your browser and run the bookmarklet.

### To add bookmarklet:
##### 1. Highlight all the text in the textbox
##### 2. Copy it by either doing ctrl+c or left clicking and hitting "Copy"
##### 3. Bookmark the website (ctrl+d or hit the star to the right of the url)
##### 4. Rename it to whatever you want.
##### 5. click the "More" button
##### 6. Paste the code into the url bar, either with ctrl+v or ctrl+shift+v or left clicking and hitting paste.
##### 7. You're all set! Just click the bookmarklet to run the js.
